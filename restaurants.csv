The latter is because every soufflé on the menu is made by chef-owner Jacqueline Margulis who has been whisking eggs into towers of heaven for over 40 years—and oh right, because soufflés are basically the only thing on the menu. You’ll order one savory and one sweet (with possibly some onion soup to start) and you’ll share it all (the soufflés are meant for two). And then you’ll make your next reservation before you leave because they’re hard to get (and easier to make if you’re in-person).

That relaxed ambiance also translates to the food, which is robust, layered, full of spice, and meant to be shared. We would never recommend you put your date to any kind of test, but it is worth noting that sharing food is a great way to get a glimpse into your date’s personality. How do they handle ordering negotiations? Will they know in advance the trio of spread requires additional flatbread? (Well, now you do, anyway.)

The restaurant showcases traditional dishes, specific to the East Bay and Monterey regions, and ingredients (think venison, chia seeds, and acorns) of the Ohlone through the modern lens of co-chefs and owners Vincent Medina and Louis Trevino, and got its start as a pop-up that was upended by the pandemic. Deciding to work with the Hearst Museum was a fraught one; the museum’s former director caused the tribe to lose federal recognition. Medina and Trevino opted to take the opportunity for healing, and using the stunning outdoor space to create an untraditional, educational dining experience. Filled with native plants and centered around sustainable redwood tables and seats, Cafe Ohlone can be experienced for tea hour, or a set lunch or brunch.

Luau Lounge is randomly part of Players Sports Bar, so it’s kind of like a fun, semi-secret bar within a bar.

All of the chicken is Mary’s free range organic and you can get it fried or flipped (slow-roasted rotisserie). Obviously, we get it fried. Technically, twice-fried since after the bird sits in a rosemary-lemon brine for 24 hours, it’s fried at a low temp and then a higher one for a perfectly crispy and flaky crunch that stays that way even factoring in delivery time. The entree comes with one leg, one thigh, half a breast, a buttermilk biscuit, honey butter, and a tomato cucumber salad.

The plant-based menu focuses on high quality, seasonal ingredients culled from the local Old Oakland farmers market and other local farms. The menu is always changing, resulting in delightful surprises like Rendang and Nami Lemak with jackfruit that’s caramelized in a house-made spice paste with coconut pandan rice, and a Shaobing sandwich that’s only available on Fridays and Saturday, with roasted sweet potato and preserved Chinese mustard greens on bread that’s baked in-house. The restaurant is also moving toward a cooperative model, and current staff-inspired dishes also appear on the menu.

There are so many stars on the menu that it’s hard to name the one that shines brightest, but if we had to choose, it’s the pasta dishes. Of those, the Dry-Aged Beef Timballo, an indulgent nine-layer lasagna-esque (but with thinner layers of pasta) dish, would probably take home the Oscar, but would certainly thank the others in its acceptance speech. While a full decadent dinner in Sorella’s dining room is a must, another excellent option is to sit at the bar and order snacks from the bar-only Cicchetti menu, paired with Italian-inspired craft cocktails, amaro (there are dozens to choose from), and Italian wine. Our favorites: the Potato Leek Focaccia, fancy “cacio e pepe” potato chips, sausage-filled and breaded olives, veal meatballs, and the best chicken wings we’ve ever had (yes, seriously)—which are stuffed with calabrese sausage and tossed in a honey chili glaze.

The menu is extensive, but favorite dishes include the golden rolls (fried, but egg-less), the papaya salad, the spicy sweet and sour soup, and the spicy Mongolian delight. Oh, and the smoothies are legit if you just need a healthy pick-me-up; the avocado one could be a meal on its own.

Not only does the restaurant work exclusively with local and seasonal produce as a way to support farmers and leave a smaller carbon footprint, but all of the dishes are fresh, flavorful, and satisfying—like the king trumpet mushroom ceviche and fall pie with Brussels sprouts, truffled bechamel, red onions, apples, chili flakes, cashew mozzarella, parmesan, and lemon agrumato. Wildseed feels like any other popular restaurant with friendly service, a lively crowd, and welcoming vibe—we’re pretty sure this is key to creating a shift in the way people perceive eating better for themselves and the earth; the restaurant needs to feel welcoming, the food needs to taste good, and ideally, there will be lots of excellent cocktails. Wildseed delivers on all three.

The menu is seasonal and changes based on what’s available at their organic farm in Pleasants Valley, in addition to being totally vegan. Go for plantain French toast or potato and tempeh chorizo hash for brunch or sweet potato flautas and a zucchini squash quesadilla for dinner. Gracias Madre also has a full bar with plenty of tequila and mezcal options, including a weekday happy hour from 2–6 pm and Margarita Mondays when margaritas are $5 all day.

Our favorite is the Mustang Relish burger, which has a crispy veggie patty, vegan bacon, egg, and cheese, lots of mustard, and is topped with pickles and red onions all on a wholemeal bun.

Before the Mensho’s and Ippudo’s of San Francisco, the latter was the city’s most talked-about ramen. It still is one of the best, being a tad less fatty-rich than its tonkotsu peers, which invites adding braised pork belly and an egg as a garnish to fully round it out. Ask for uncooked noodles if you plan to enjoy your ramen a little later.

Everybody is so focused on the house scallop dashi ramen that it’s easy to overlook the also excellent “zen ramen” (a vegan ramen bowl with a white soy sauce broth), inspired by traditional shoujin temple techniques, and tori paitan (chicken and pork dashi broth), both of which are excellent options, especially if you’re eating at home since scallops don’t always travel well.

For good measure, the lobster “house specialty” ramens come topped with a deep-fried soft-shell crab, which turns out to be the greatest soup garnish ever (forget about those oyster crackers in clam chowder).

But if you want authentic, Chicago-style pizza served on five types of crusts (deep dish, eight-inch deep dish, cast iron pan, cracker-thin, and stuffed), you’ll have to trek two blocks to Capo’s, a neighborhood joint that caters to tourists and locals alike and feels like it was always meant to be a part of the North Beach food landscape. Each style is made with Ceresota Flour from one of the oldest mills in Chicago, and our favorite is the Italian Stallion (mozzarella, fontina, Italian beef, Chicago Italian sausage, horseradish cream sauce, chives, sweet peppers, and Romano). And while the pizza is enough to keep us coming back, it’s worth mentioning that there are over 100 whiskies on the menu.

There are over ten rotating pizzas to choose from with ingredients based on seasonality, but if the Wild Nettles with pancetta, mushrooms, red onions, and aged Italian provolone is on the menu, get it.

It’s pizza like what you loved when you were a kid, only so much better because now you’re old enough to appreciate the sourdough crust that is somehow crunchy and chewy all at the same time. Not sure which one to order? Hilda’s Favorite (goat cheese, pesto, tomato) named after the mama goat who used to roam the lot behind the original Potrero location with her two kids) is our go-to.

Obviously, you need to make it your mission to eat every single type, but we suggest starting with the Margherita Napoletana, the World Pizza Cup winner in Naples, Italy (only 73 are made each day), and the Don Giovanni, which is coal-fired in a 1,000-degree oven, and topped with vodka tomato cream sauce. There are also some excellent appetizers—like the meatball gigante, which is probably a pound of veal, pork, and beef (get the one topped with a farm egg and calabrese).

And for everything we love about its new and improved look, what we also love is that its not-so-secret hidden back bar, the Hideout, feels much the same. With dark, moody, cozy, and casual, with red walls and cushy banquettes, the only major change is its menu of classic cocktails.
